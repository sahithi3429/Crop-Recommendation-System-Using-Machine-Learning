🌾 Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
This project presents a Crop Recommendation System built using Machine Learning algorithms to help farmers and agricultural planners select the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various environmental and soil parameters. The aim is to enhance agricultural productivity, optimize land use, and support sustainable farming practices.

📌 Project Overview
The system takes into account key agricultural features such as:

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels in the soil

Temperature

Humidity

pH level of the soil

Rainfall

Using this data, the model predicts the most suitable crop to grow in a specific region or condition. The system supports real-time user input through a web-based interface.

🧠 Technologies & Tools Used
Python for backend development

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Flask for deploying the web application

HTML/CSS for the frontend UI

Jupyter Notebook for model development and analysis

⚙️ Machine Learning Models
We experimented with multiple algorithms including:

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Among these, Random Forest achieved the best accuracy and generalization performance, making it the core model for deployment.

🖥️ Web Application Features
Clean, responsive interface for user input

Backend integration with the trained ML model

Real-time prediction of crop recommendations

Option to retrain or update the model with new data
